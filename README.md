Design a continuous state diagram that outputs 1 when it receives
an even number of 0s or even number of 1â€™s. Assume: start state
with no input has even number of zeroes and even numbers of
ones. You should not follow a behavioral paradigm. Events should
take place at each rising edge; signals are referenced at the same
time.
